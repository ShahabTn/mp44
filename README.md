This is my hobby project, the Macropad 44 (mp44). It includes two rotary encoders, per-key RGB lighting, and underglow lighting for easy layer identification. Powered by the RP2040 microcontroller with 256KB of SRAM, it offers ample space for complex macros, tap-dances, combos, and more. The files and code are based on Vial firmware, enabling you to clone the Vial repository to generate the required Vial.uf2 file for the Macropad. The PCB was manufactured by JLCPCB in China, and the upper and lower plates are made from either stainless steel with injected plastic or laser-cut acrylic. Two frames are crafted from 3mm (upper-side) or 4mm (bottom-side) thick acrylic.

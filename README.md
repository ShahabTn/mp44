This is my hobby project, the Macropad 44 (MP44), featuring two rotary encoders, per-key RGB lighting, and underglow lighting, which I use for layer identification. It's powered by the RP2040 microcontroller, which provides 256KB of SRAM.
The files and code are based on the Vial firmware. You can clone the Vial repository and use it to create the necessary Vial .uf2 file for the Macropad.
